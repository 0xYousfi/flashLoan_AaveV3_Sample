# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.


It consists of running a dummy example of a flash loan using aave v3 protocol.

The flash loan is about borrowing USDC amount from a aave liquidity pool and swap it in an Dex ( dummy one ) with DAI token.
